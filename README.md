Content Based Filtering for AI Recommendation Model

Content-based filtering (CBF) is a method of recommendation in which items are recommended based on a comparison between the content of the items and a user profile. The content of each item is represented as a set of descriptors or terms, typically the words that describe the items' attributes, and these are compared with the user profile, which describes the types of items this user likes.

In content-based filtering, items are represented as vectors in a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a feature of the items. The similarity between items is calculated using metrics like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or the dot product, depending on the nature of the vector space. For instance, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two item vectors, indicating how close they are directionally, regardless of their magnitude​.

This approach has several advantages, such as handling new items that have not yet been rated by users, since it doesn't rely on user interactions but rather on the features of the items themselves. It also provides transparency in the recommendation process by making it clear why items are being recommended based on their features. However, one of its disadvantages is the limitation in the features used. If the features don't capture all the reasons a user may like an item, the recommendations may not be accurate. Furthermore, this method tends to recommend items similar to those already rated by the user, potentially leading to a lack of diversity in the recommendations​.

In the context of our project, which uses sentence transformers to generate semantic embeddings of movie descriptions, content-based filtering fits well. We can enhance the descriptive power of our item profiles by incorporating rich semantic features derived from text descriptions using advanced NLP models. By doing so, we're able to capture a deeper understanding of the content, which should lead to more accurate recommendations based on the actual content of the movies rather than just surface-level metadata. This approach can help us overcome some of the traditional limitations of content-based filtering by providing a more nuanced view of what each movie is about, thus potentially increasing the diversity and accuracy of our recommendations.
